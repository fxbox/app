> An app for [Project Link](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Project_Link)

## Support

The following browsers are actively supported:

* Firefox Nightly for Android
* Chrome Beta for Android
* Safari for iOS 9

## Prerequisites

Assuming you have git and [nvm](http://nvm.sh/) installed, clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fxbox/app
$ cd app
```

And then run:

```bash
$ nvm install v4.2.2
$ nvm use v4.2.2
$ npm install -g gulp
$ npm install
```

## How to build?

```bash
$ gulp
```

Then point your browser to [https://localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000/) and
accept security exception for self-signed
development certificate.

By default app is served via `https` using self-signed certificate from `certs`
folder. Certificate is valid for ~100 years and generated with the following
command:

```bash
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 36500 -nodes
```

In case custom certificate is required you can either override respective files
in `certs` folder or change certificate and private key paths in `webserver`
gulp task in `gulpfile.js`.

Even though it's not recommended sometimes you may want to switch to `http`, for
that purpose just comment out `https` config property in `webserver` gulp task
in `gulpfile.js`. Check out official [gulp-webserver module page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-webserver)
for possible options as well. And don't forget to flip it back while running
integration tests as they will still assume that app is run via `https`.

Note: The app is built in the `dist/app` folder.

### Prerequisites

There are a couple of steps that you must do in order to have push notifications
working. As they rely on Service Workers, make sure you follow the next steps:

* Push Notification will need **HTTPS everywhere**, so be sure your `foxbox` is
running over SSL.
* Visit `https://knilxof.org:4443/ping` and add a permanent exception for the
certificate.
* When developing locally (https://localhost:8000) add permanent exception for
the self self-signed certificate.

### Tips and tricks

* To start over with a new test, clean the web push database in the foxbox:
```rm -rf $HOME/.local/share/foxbox/webpush.sqlite``` and start a Firefox
instance with a new profile ```<path to firefox bin> --profile /tmp/<random>```.
* If you want to perform multiple tries with same profile try to use a service
like `xip.io`. Where you can have different names pointing to your local ip like
`https://myname.<my local ip>.xip.io:8000` for using this, remember to launch
your gulp task like `HOST=<my local ip> gulp`. Doing this you are creating
different origins, which will make you receive multiple notifications (as many
as app origin registered).

## Tests

### All regular tests

Run `npm test`.

### Run end-to-end tests (e2e)

Steps (to be scripted soon):

1. Clone [foxbox](https://github.com/fxbox/foxbox/)
2. Run it with `cargo run`
3. With a browser, perform the first time setup by going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
4. Run `gulp test-e2e`
